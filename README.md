# Junior Vue.js developer test task

You need to create a simple To-Do List web application that will allow users to add, edit, and delete tasks.

### Requirements:

1\. Use Vue.js to Create Components and Manage Application State.

2\. The interface must contain the following elements:

`  `- Input field for adding a new task.

`  `- "Add" button to add a new task to the list.

`  `- List of added tasks with the ability to mark completed or delete a task.

`  `- Optional: Add an "Edit" button so that users can change the text of the task after adding it.

3\. Tasks should be saved in application state and should not disappear after page reload.

4\. Layout and design can be simple, but must be readable and aesthetically pleasing.

### Solution:

1. To solve the problem, I used VUE, VUEX, VUE3-notification, Font Awesome and IndexDB.
1. Development application runs on port 5173.
